## Step 1
Welcome to Numerology!

Numerology is the leading Number Processing company in Numberland, and you are
starting out as a new recruit in the Prestigeous First Array Processing Unit, 
Subdivision Integer numbers.

In order to prepare the new recruits, Numerology regularly gives the recruits
problems to work on. 

For the first task, you will implement a number replacer which replaces all 
9's by two tens.

As in the example below:

>  input: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
>
>  output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,10,10

## Step 2
For the next task, you will extend the functionality by replacing all 2's
by an equal amount of ones as the number to the left of the 2, and all 6's by
an equal amount of 3's as the value of the number which is an equal amount of
steps to the right of the 6 as the number which is to the immediate left of it.

As in the examples below

> input: 3,2,3,4,5
>
> output: 3,1,1,1,3,4,5

> input: 1,6,3,4,5
>
> output: 1,3,3,3,3,4,5
